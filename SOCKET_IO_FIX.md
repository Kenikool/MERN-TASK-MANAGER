# Socket.IO Infinite Loop Fix

## Problem
The frontend was experiencing an infinite loop of Socket.IO polling requests that returned 404 errors:
```
GET /socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=polling&t=cputfhs4 404 0.748 ms - 92
GET /socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=polling&t=cputzswx 404 0.846 ms - 92
...
```

## Root Cause
The backend server didn't have Socket.IO configured, even though:
1. `socket.io` was installed as a dependency
2. The frontend was trying to connect to Socket.IO endpoints
3. The frontend SocketContext was properly configured

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Socket.IO Configuration
- Added Socket.IO server setup in `backend/server.js`
- Configured CORS for Socket.IO to allow frontend connections
- Added proper event handlers for real-time features

### 2. Authentication Middleware
- Created `backend/middleware/socketAuth.js` for Socket.IO authentication
- Allows both authenticated and anonymous connections
- Validates JWT tokens when provided

### 3. Real-time Event Handlers
Added handlers for:
- User authentication and online status
- Project and task room management
- Real-time task and project updates
- Typing indicators
- Timer events
- Notifications
- User connection/disconnection

### 4. Frontend Authentication
- Updated SocketContext to send authentication data on connection
- Added user ID and name to the authentication payload

### 5. Health Check Endpoints
- `/api/health` - General server health with Socket.IO status
- `/api/socket/health` - Specific Socket.IO server status

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/server.js` - Added Socket.IO configuration and event handlers
- `backend/middleware/socketAuth.js` - New authentication middleware

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/context/SocketContext.jsx` - Added authentication on connect

## Testing the Fix

1. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check Socket.IO health:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/socket/health
   ```

3. **Start the frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Verify connection:**
   - Open browser console
   - Look for "âœ… Connected to WebSocket server" message
   - No more 404 errors for `/socket.io/` endpoints

## Features Now Available

- Real-time task updates
- Online user presence
- Typing indicators
- Live notifications
- Project collaboration
- Timer synchronization

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your frontend `.env`:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
VITE_ENABLE_WEBSOCKET=true
```

## Troubleshooting

If you still see connection issues:

1. **Check CORS configuration** - Ensure your frontend URL is in the CORS origins
2. **Verify JWT_SECRET** - Make sure it's set in backend `.env`
3. **Check firewall** - Ensure port 5000 is accessible
4. **Browser console** - Look for specific error messages

The Socket.IO server now gracefully handles connection failures and falls back to offline mode when needed.
